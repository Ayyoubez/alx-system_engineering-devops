Three-Server Web Infrastructure  with Load Balancer Cluster

Components:

2 servers for web server,application server, database
2 load balancers (HAProxy) configured as a cluster

-----------------------------------------------------

Explanation:

Server Split: Each component (web server, application server, database) is hosted on its own server to improve performance, security, and maintainability. This separation allows for better resource allocation and isolation of services.
Load Balancer Cluster: HAProxy is configured as a cluster with the other load balancer for high availability and fault tolerance. This ensures that if one load balancer fails, the other can continue to distribute traffic.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Why Add Each Element:

Additional Servers: Splitting components onto separate servers improves scalability and allows for easier management and maintenance of each service.
Load Balancer Cluster: Ensures continuous availability of the load balancing service and prevents it from becoming a single point of failure in the infrastructure.
This design enhances the overall reliability and performance of the web infrastructure by distributing the workload across multiple servers and ensuring that critical components like the load balancer are highly available.
