#Issue Summary

###Duration of the outage:
June 1, 2024, 10:00 AM to June 1, 2024, 12:30 PM (UTC)

###Impact:
Our main web application experienced a complete outage, affecting approximately 95% of users. Users were unable to access the service, leading to widespread frustration and potential financial losses.

###Root Cause:
A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings during a routine update caused an uneven distribution of incoming traffic, overwhelming the web servers.

Timeline
10:00 AM: Monitoring alert triggered, showing a significant drop in successful HTTP requests.
10:05 AM: Engineering team begins investigation, initially focusing on web server performance.
10:15 AM: Web server logs analyzed; no significant issues found.
10:30 AM: Attention shifted to database performance due to a spike in query volume.
11:00 AM: Database team finds no issues, escalates to the networking team.
11:15 AM: Networking team discovers anomalies in load balancer logs.
11:30 AM: Load balancer misconfiguration identified as the cause.
11:45 AM: Load balancer settings corrected, normalizing traffic distribution.
12:00 PM: Service starts stabilizing.
12:30 PM: Full service restoration confirmed, monitoring shows normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings during a routine update. The misconfigured load balancer's round-robin algorithm directed an excessive number of requests to a single web server, causing it to become overwhelmed and fail. This created a ripple effect, resulting in other servers being unable to handle the increased load effectively.

Resolution:
The issue was resolved by identifying and correcting the misconfiguration in the load balancer. The steps taken included:

Reverting the load balancer to its previous configuration.
Implementing a patch to prevent similar issues during future updates.
Testing load balancer configurations in a staging environment before deploying to production.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:

Improve configuration management for the load balancer.
Enhance monitoring and alerting systems for load balancer performance.
Conduct regular audits of load balancer settings.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Patch Load Balancer: Implement validation checks in the update process to prevent misconfigurations.
Add Monitoring: Deploy more granular monitoring on server load and traffic distribution to detect anomalies quickly.
Staging Environment Testing: Ensure all configuration changes are tested in a staging environment before being applied to production.
Incident Response Training: Train the engineering and networking teams on identifying and resolving load balancer issues promptly.
Update Documentation: Revise internal documentation to include post-update verification steps for load balancer settings.
Regular Audits: Schedule regular audits of critical infrastructure components, including load balancers, to ensure optimal configurations.
By addressing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to reduce the likelihood of similar outages in the future and improve the overall reliability and resilience of our system.
