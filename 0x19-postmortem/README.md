Issue Summary
Duration of the outage:
June 1, 2024, 10:00 AM to June 1, 2024, 12:30 PM (UTC)

Impact:
Our main web application went on an unexpected two-and-a-half-hour vacation, leaving 95% of our users stranded in the digital wilderness. Users experienced a complete service outage, leading to widespread frustration and a chorus of "Is it down for you too?"

Root Cause:
A load balancer configuration mishap during a routine update caused our web servers to be less balanced than a unicyclist on a tightrope.

Timeline

10:00 AM: Monitoring alert sounds like an air raid siren, indicating a sharp drop in successful HTTP requests.
10:05 AM: Engineers leap into action, assuming web servers have decided to take a nap.
10:15 AM: Web server logs show they're awake and just as confused as we are.
10:30 AM: Attention shifts to the database, because, why not? It's always the database, right?
11:00 AM: Database team gives a thumbs-up; issue escalates to the networking team.
11:15 AM: Networking team spots weird behavior in the load balancer logs.
11:30 AM: Root cause found: a misconfigured load balancer was playing favorites with one unlucky server.
11:45 AM: Load balancer settings fixed, traffic distribution goes back to normal.
12:00 PM: Services start to recover, users begin to return from the wilderness.
12:30 PM: Full service restoration confirmed. Cheers all around!
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The load balancer, in a moment of sheer mischief, was misconfigured during a routine update. This led it to send an overwhelming number of requests to a single web server, causing it to crash under pressure and leaving other servers twiddling their thumbs.

Resolution:
We restored balance to the force (and our servers) by identifying the misconfiguration and correcting it. Steps included:

Rolling back to the previous, non-mischievous load balancer configuration.
Implementing a patch to prevent future shenanigans.
Testing configurations in a safe, non-production playground (also known as a staging environment).
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:

Load Balancer Configuration Management: Ensuring the load balancer is no longer a rogue agent.
Enhanced Monitoring: More eyes (virtual ones) on server load and traffic distribution.
Regular Audits: Keeping our configurations as polished as our release notes.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Patch Load Balancer: Introduce validation checks to prevent misconfigurations.
Add Monitoring: Deploy detailed monitoring for server load and traffic anomalies.
Staging Environment Testing: Mandate testing of all changes in staging before production.
Incident Response Training: Educate teams on swift load balancer issue resolution.
Update Documentation: Include post-update load balancer verification steps.
Regular Audits: Schedule routine audits of load balancer configurations.

By addressing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to keep our service as reliable as a Swiss watch, ensuring a smoother experience for our users and a less stressful one for our engineers.
